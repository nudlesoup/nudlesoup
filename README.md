👋 Hi there!

Machine Learning Engineer specializing in scalable vision systems and production-grade AI.
I build, optimize, and deploy end-to-end ML solutions that perform reliably in the real world.

🚀 AI @ Scale: Architected computer vision and optimization systems across 2,000+ NVIDIA Jetson edge devices, boosting prescription throughput +25% and reducing latency in pharmacy automation.

⚡ Real-Time Inference Optimization: Deployed YOLOv8 + DeepSORT with TensorRT, FP16/INT8 quantization, and tracking improvements — achieving +40% faster inference and 30% lower memory.

🧪 Research + Innovation: Published in Pattern Recognition (2023) for self-supervised 3D egocentric human pose estimation, improving SOTA by +12%.

🧰 Full-Stack ML Ownership: Data → Modeling → MLOps → Deployment → Monitoring, with Docker, CI/CD, model registry, edge deployment, and observability.

🛠️ Prior experience includes sim2real CV at Radius AI (+10 mAP, 2× labeling efficiency with SAM) and software engineering at Tesco (optimized routing for 50,000+ POS systems).
